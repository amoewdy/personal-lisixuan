People relieve psychological problems mainly through leisure and entertainment, but that doesn't solve the problem.

                            I'm afraid that other people might think I am too weak, and I also agree that seeking help is a sign of weakness. They might say "We have experienced these. Do not be so hypocritical " or "It’s such a small problem". It seems like everyone else is strong and able to handle these problems.<br/>
                            Still, when you get sick you can not only go to the hospital, but also find home medicine boxes. I really want to deal with emotional problems in a private way.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>
                Sandplay is a powerful therapeutic technique that facilitates the psyche’s natural capacity for healing.<br/>
                In a “free and protected” space provided by the analyst, a client creates a concrete manifestation of his or her imaginal world using sand, water, and miniature objects.<br/>
                In this way Sandplay helps honor and illuminate the client’s internal symbolic world and provides a place for its expression within a safe container, the tray filled with sand. With sufficient time and understanding, this experience can lead to the development of a new psychic structure of the personality.
